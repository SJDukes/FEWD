  <h1>Whales</h1>

  <p>Wikipedia tells us this about

  </p>

  <p>
    Whale is the common name for various marine
    mammals of the order Cetacea. The term whale sometimes refers to all cetaceans, but more
    often it excludes dolphins and porpoises, which belong to the suborder Odontoceti.
    This suborder includes the sperm whale, killer whale, pilot whale, and beluga whale.
    The other cetacean suborder, Mysticeti, comprises filter feeders who eat small organisms
    caught by straining seawater through a comblike structure found in the mouth called baleen.
    This suborder includes the blue whale, the humpback whale, the bowhead whale and the minke whale.
    All cetaceans have forelimbs modified as fins, a tail with horizontal flukes, and nasal openings on top of the head.

  <p>But I like whales because they are:
    <ul>
      <li>Huge!</li>
      <li>Friendly</li>
      <li>Can hold their breath for a long time</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Whale Anatomy</h2>

  <p> These are some key poitns to a whale's anatomy that I think are interesting.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p><b>Blowhole:</b>
          Whales breathe via blowholes; baleen whales have two and toothed whales have one.
          These are located on the top of the head, allowing the animal to remain almost completely
          submerged while breathing. Breathing involves expelling stale air (which is warm and moist),
          as well as some mucus and excess water from the blowhole, forming an upward, steamy spout,
          followed by inhaling fresh air into the lungs. Spout shapes differ among species,
          which facilitates identification.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><b>Ears:</b>
          The whale ear has specific adaptations to the marine environment. In humans, the middle ear works as
          an impedance equalizer between the outside air's low impedance and the cochlear fluid's high impedance.
          In aquatic mammals, such as whales, however, there is no great difference between the outer and inner
          environments. Instead of sound passing through the outer ear to the middle ear, whales receive sound
          through the throat, from which it passes through a low-impedance fat-filled cavity to the inner ear.
          The whale ear is acoustically isolated from the skull by air-filled sinus pockets, which allow for
          greater directional hearing underwater.

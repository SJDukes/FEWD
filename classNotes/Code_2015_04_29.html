      li.todo-item


On an <input> element, the type = text allows us to access the value to set it as an element's text content.
Form -> have a submit event that allows us to tie an event handler to the event
The event submit can only happen on a form

form submit allows the submit to listen to the "enter"
versus button click only works when you click the button

Arrays *******************************
generic object:

  var car = {
    color: "blue",
    make: "corvet",
    <key>: <value>
  }

instructors = ["Avand", "Rob", "Sandi"];

New object type: array
  properties: length -> instructors.length
  methods:
    1) sort()
    2) push() - add item to end of array
    3) pop() - takes last thing off the end of the array, no arguments

var a = [ 1,2,3];  [1,2,3] is called an object literal
object literal because the syntax constructs the object for you, unlike something like new Date

a.length -> returns 3
a.push(4);  -> array is no [1,2,3,4]
a.pop(); -> array is now [1,2,3]
a.pop() returns the item you popped off -> 4
arrays: start at index 0;
stored as a generic object

var a ={
  0: "Avand",
  1: "Rob",
  2: "Sandi"
}

To access the value: array[<index>]

for loop ********************************
for (initializer, condition, final expression ) {
}
}
  * initializer - executed once
  * condition - do work if condition is true
  * final expression - execute after work is done

for ( var i=0; i < a.length, i = i+ 1) {

}

every other item: i = i + 2
skip first item: var i = 1
